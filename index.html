<h2> CSS stands for : Cascading Style Sheets </h2>

   <td> CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document<br>
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
    (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br>
         CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
  alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>

     1) Faster Page Speed<br>
     More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.<br>
     <br>
     2) Better User Experience<br>
     CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.<br>
     <br>
     3) Quicker Development Time<br>
     With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.<br>
     <br>
     4) Easy Formatting Changes<br>
     If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.<br>
     <br>
     5) Compatibility Across Devices<br>
     Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.</div>
